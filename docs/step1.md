## Step 1: Getting started

### Symlink assets

Let's start working on the project itself! After the previous step is completed (either with CDE or the `cca`, or just duplicate the [begin](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/workshop/begin) step), you should symlink in the common resources for Eh - the symlink should be created as a peer of `manifest.json`.

For CDE and the sample code, this will look like:

    ln -s /path/to/workshop-cca-eh/common EhWorkApp/common

And if you created your project with the `cca`, this will look like:

    ln -s /path/to/workshop-cca-eh/common EhWorkApp/www/common

If you'd like to regenerate these resources (advanced, via Bower) then see [README.md](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/README.md#Advanced).

### Polymer scaffolding

Let's replace the default application with something more unique. This involves changing the default HTML, JS and CSS files.

#### HTML

Open `index.html`, and update the `<head>` to look like this-
  
    <head>
      <title>Eh</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
      <link rel="import" href="common/vulcanized.html"><!-- generated by prepare.sh -->
      <script src="main.js"></script>
    </head>

And update `<body>` with our default Polymer elements and `eh-contact-list`:

    <body unresolved>
      <core-header-panel>
        <core-toolbar>
          <core-icon-button icon="menu" on-tap="{{menuAction}}"></core-icon-button>
          <h3 flex>Eh</h3>
          <core-icon-button icon="more-vert" on-tap="{{moreAction}}"></core-icon-button>
        </core-toolbar>

        <eh-contact-list id="contacts"></eh-contact-list>

      </core-header-panel>
    </body>

#### JS

Now that our app is Polymer-based, we need to listen for the `polymer-ready` event to get started. Replace the contents of `main.js`, our foreground script, with these lines-

    window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function(e) {
      var contacts = [
        { name: "Loonie" },
        { name: "Toonie" }
      ];
      document.getElementById('contacts').contacts = contacts;
    });

We'll add more code in here later. But for now, this just creates a couple of test contacts.

#### CSS

Finally, the page needs a coat of paint. In fact, it won't display at all without some CSS, as our elements aren't being grown to fill the page's height.

    html, body {
      height: 100%;
      margin: 0;
      background-color: #E5E5E5;
    }

    body {
      overflow: auto;
    }

    core-header-panel {
      height: 100%;
      overflow: auto;
      -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    }

    core-toolbar {
      background: #03a9f4;
      color: white;
    }

### Play it again

If you run your app again, you should see something like this-

Congratulations!
