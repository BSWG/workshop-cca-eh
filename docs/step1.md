## Step 1: Getting started

### Create a new project

Start the Chrome Dev Editor. If this is the first time using the editor, you may be prompted with some initial setup steps.

Select `New Project...`, then enter 'EhWorkApp', select the type `JavaScript Chrome App`, and tap `Create`.
_You don't need to select `(using Polymer paper elements)`, as this workshop contains common resources for these depedencies._

The editor will create a basic Chrome app that can be run on desktop or on mobile.

* At any point, press the play button in the top-left of the editor to preview in Chrome.

* To preview the app on Android, right-click on your project's name (e.g. 'EhWorkApp') and tap `Deploy to Mobile...`.

[//]: # (TODO(samthor): reference CADT from README.md)

Alternatively, you can use `cca` on the command-line. Run:

    cca create EhWorkApp

From within the new `EhWorkApp` folder, you can then run either:

    cca run chrome

You can also use `android` or `ios` (with optional `--device`, to use a physically connected device) in place of `chrome`, to run on mobile, such as:

    cca run --device android

### Symlink assets

Once the project is created (either with CDE or `cca`), you should symlink in the common resources for Eh -- the symlink should be created as a peer of `manifest.json`.

For CDE, this will look like:

    ln -s /path/to/workshop-cca-eh/common EhWorkApp/common

And for the `cca`, this will look like:

    ln -s /path/to/workshop-cca-eh/common EhWorkApp/www/common

If you'd like to regenerate these resources (advanced, via Bower) then see [README.md](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/README.md).

### Polymer scaffolding

Let's replace the default application with something more unique. This involves changing the default HTML, JS and CSS files.

#### HTML

Open `index.html`, and update the `<head>` to look like this-
  
    <head>
      <title>Eh</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
      <link rel="import" href="common/vulcanized.html"><!-- generated by prepare.sh -->
      <script src="main.js"></script>
    </head>

And update `<body>` with our default Polymer elements and `eh-contact-list`:
  
    <core-header-panel>
      <core-toolbar>
        <core-icon-button icon="menu" on-tap="{{menuAction}}"></core-icon-button>
        <h3 flex>Eh</h3>
        <core-icon-button icon="more-vert" on-tap="{{moreAction}}"></core-icon-button>
      </core-toolbar>

      <eh-contact-list id="contacts"></eh-contact-list>

    </core-header-panel>

#### JS

Now that our app is Polymer-based, we need to listen for the `polymer-ready` event to get started. Replace the contents of `main.js`, our foreground script, with these lines-

    window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function(e) {
    });

We'll add more code in here later.

#### CSS

Finally, the page needs a coat of paint. In fact, it won't display at all without some CSS, as our elements aren't being grown to fill the page's height.

    html, body {
      height: 100%;
      margin: 0;
      background-color: #E5E5E5;
    }

    body {
      overflow: auto;
    }

    core-header-panel {
      height: 100%;
      overflow: auto;
      -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    }

    core-toolbar {
      background: #03a9f4;
      color: white;
    }

### Play it again

If you run your app again, you should see something like this-

Congratulations!
