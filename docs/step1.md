## Step 1: Getting started

### Create a new project

Start the Chrome Dev Editor. If this is the first time using the editor, you may be prompted with some initial setup steps.

Select `New Project...`, then enter 'EhWorkApp', select the type `JavaScript Chrome App`, and tap `Create`.
_You don't need to select **(using Polymer paper elements)**, as this workshop contains common resources for Polymer already._

The editor will create a basic Chrome app that can be run on desktop or on mobile. Alternatively, the code for this is in  [begin](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/workshop/begin), and you can use `Open Folder...` to select and start with it.

#### Deploy

Right-click on the project and either select **Run** for desktop, or **Deploy To Mobile** for mobile. _As per [README.md](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/README.md), you'll need [CADT](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/README.md#deploy-to-mobile) installed on your mobile device_.

#### Advanced

Alternatively, you can use the `cca` via command-line to create the initial project-

    cca create EhWorkApp

From within the new `EhWorkApp` folder, you can then run on your native platform of choice-

    cca run chrome
    cca run android --device
    cca run ios --device

Alternatively, you can actively push to the CADT host app from `EhWorkApp/www`-

    cca push --watch

Or finally, you can open the `EhWorkApp/www` folder in the Chrome Dev Editor and follow the instructions above to start.

### Symlink assets

Let's start working on the project itself!

Once it's created (either with CDE or the `cca`), you should symlink in the common resources for Eh - the symlink should be created as a peer of `manifest.json`.

For CDE, this will look like:

    ln -s /path/to/workshop-cca-eh/common EhWorkApp/common

And if you created your project with the `cca`, this will look like:

    ln -s /path/to/workshop-cca-eh/common EhWorkApp/www/common

If you'd like to regenerate these resources (advanced, via Bower) then see [README.md](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/workshop-cca-eh/blob/master/README.md#Advanced).

### Polymer scaffolding

Let's replace the default application with something more unique. This involves changing the default HTML, JS and CSS files.

#### HTML

Open `index.html`, and update the `<head>` to look like this-
  
    <head>
      <title>Eh</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
      <link rel="import" href="common/vulcanized.html"><!-- generated by prepare.sh -->
      <script src="main.js"></script>
    </head>

And update `<body>` with our default Polymer elements and `eh-contact-list`:

    <body unresolved>
      <core-header-panel>
        <core-toolbar>
          <core-icon-button icon="menu" on-tap="{{menuAction}}"></core-icon-button>
          <h3 flex>Eh</h3>
          <core-icon-button icon="more-vert" on-tap="{{moreAction}}"></core-icon-button>
        </core-toolbar>

        <eh-contact-list id="contacts"></eh-contact-list>

      </core-header-panel>
    </body>

#### JS

Now that our app is Polymer-based, we need to listen for the `polymer-ready` event to get started. Replace the contents of `main.js`, our foreground script, with these lines-

    window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function(e) {
    });

We'll add more code in here later.

#### CSS

Finally, the page needs a coat of paint. In fact, it won't display at all without some CSS, as our elements aren't being grown to fill the page's height.

    html, body {
      height: 100%;
      margin: 0;
      background-color: #E5E5E5;
    }

    body {
      overflow: auto;
    }

    core-header-panel {
      height: 100%;
      overflow: auto;
      -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    }

    core-toolbar {
      background: #03a9f4;
      color: white;
    }

### Play it again

If you run your app again, you should see something like this-

Congratulations!
